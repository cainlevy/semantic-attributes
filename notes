SEMANTIC ATTRIBUTES

=NEXT=
------------------
build the conversion from core validations
problem: @record.errors.full_messages adds the field name ... ugh ... i want to sprintf instead ... may have to give up
need to evaluate/test the nil scenario for every predicate
regex patterns should not use ^$ anchors ... they should use \A and \Z (test broken lines)

=OTHER PREDICATES=
------------------
file (with automatic detection of file_column and others)
us_zip (enumerated)
us_state (aliased)
